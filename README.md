### Sokoban game ###

A Sokoban game made for an Object Oriented Programming course at ITBA (Instituto
Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires). There was given more importance in the OOP design 
than in the UI, but anyway looks pretty good according to what was expected in
the first versions.

Unluckily, the commit history has been lost and you might see some comments
(Javadoc or not) that are Spanish.

This entire project has been made by me (Daniel Lobo), Teresa C. Di Tada and
Felipe Martinez and is release under the terms stated in LICENSE.
